## Spatial Ownership - Rough Draft
The Ownership Concept must be explicitly loaded and introduces an Additional Mode that further Transform the functionality of the Axium. Which allows for the Locking of Values that Other Actions or Strategies may be Dependent Upon. And if that Strategy, or Action with a KeyedSelector has Taken a TicketStub of Ownership of that Value. Any Quality or Action that would Transform such are Added to a ActionQue until that Block is Cleared.

But if a Strategy is Dependent on that Value, that Strategy will Fail by Default. Thus a Specific Case must be attached to the ActionNode that Governs how to handle that Specific Case.

If an Action that has a Blocking Quality, but does not place a KeyedSelectors on its Actions. Only one Action of that Type may Exist at Once in the ActionQue.

Actions in this System are also allowed to Move off Premises and was the Inspiration for the Design of this System. That such can be a Server, Web Worker, Client, etc...

While these Actions are off Location. Their Tickets hold a Expiration time that would Invalidate said Action based upon an optionally set Agreement Value or Otherwise set to a Default Time. Freeing that Lock Automatically upon Expiration. But only if that System has Received an Additional Action. As the Gist of an Unified Turing Machine is that it only Runs as long as there are Actions in the Stream that facilitates the Mode. As it is a Recursive Function.

Before I want to point out how we are handling our higher order composition of concepts. Noting you are reverting to a heirchical stance which is incongruent with our functional approach. To point out why such doesn't make any sense in this instance is say we have two concpets being muxified, one that has the counter concept and the other it's own counter concept. Although both have the counter concept, we only care for the qualities and properties these concepts bring into each muxified concept. Wherein the hier approach would dictate some pointed origin with the counter prior to the concept's that we are muxifyig the issue is the origin of two other concepts may be an unlike origin that only share the counter concept as part of their origin. As the Conceptual Origin of these Concepts are in Part with the Original Counter Concept, but only in Part.

This is the issue when examining the Conceptual Deck System of Stratimux with the Constructual Heir Perpective. It would denote that Counter is Origin, whereas it is just Part Influence of Any Number of Concepts Before or After the Origin of the Counter Concept. As we are only maintaining the Qualities and Properties as a Mechanism of Mapping our Concepts.

Muxium would have Access to d e c k of Muxium
Where d is the Conceptual Load of
{ Concept: d e c k }
Where Concept would have access to:
{ d e c k }
Where d of Concept would have access to:
{ e c k }
Which would correspond to the qualities and properties that the Concept muxified from the Concept that would only have { e c k }

With this in mind we must Address how the Concept<CounterState, CounterQualities> is being converted to an AnyConcept despite our work thus far.

Noting this May be an Issue with the Stage Planner System and the Associated Interface.ts file attached.

This is the type information when accessing the d within our Working Stage.
(parameter) d: Deck<DECK & {
counter: AnyConcept;
} & MuxiumDeck>

# Release Disclosure
The internals of this application feature a design pattern released in 2018, ActionStrategy. This resulting framework and the creation of a Unified Turing Machine is the consequence of the complexity that this pattern imposes, despite its outward simplicity. Thus this framework simplifies the handling of its complex nature and solves the deficiencies of working with this pattern in preexisting frameworks capable of it. Noting that the Unified Turing Machine itself was an indirect discovery of the complexity of that pattern that was just higher orders of logic hiding in plain site.

**Postulate:** If intelligence is defined by tool use. Then what you do with a tool is an action, therefore: Intelligence is just a graph of actions that perform some function with a desired outcome.

Thus a "Concept" of a person written in this system can be defined by the actions they can utilize based on the context, and what tools are available. Same would be true for any other form of intelligence, including Ai. Then the goal would be the creation of a Graph Computation Framework oriented around "Actions" and "Concepts" in plain text. Would represent means of proving a hand written formalizations of intelligence in plain text. 

While the choice of license taints the ability to ever truly patent "Concepts" created for this new Unified Turing Machine. It instead reinforces the purpose of this work by providing an additional avenue of entrepreneurship, that isn't just improvements to Ai training algorithms. As this work directly relays to safety of Ai's ability to halt. It only behooves releasing and maintenance of solved "Concepts" that can be proven to halt as open source.

The a benefit of GPLv3, is that it allows for a SaaS loophole. Where functionality can be utilized as a trade secret. As the true goal of this project is the possibility of new avenue of science formalized via testing on demand, and open experimentation. The intent is the creation of a new Unified Conceptual Science via the open demonstration of logical programming as to interacts/unifies each with possible field of study.

To some this might be the holy grail of training sound logic and reasoning into Neural Networks that is comparable to our own ability to say: "I don't know, but I'll find out." For me, this is my self studied dissertation that has taken 5 hard years. A year ago, I didn't even know that Unified Science existed, and what I was attempting to prove was "Universal Concepts," as a method of finding shared similarities between fields. The Unified Turing Machine is my thesis, that it works the test, the documents shared alongside this repository the paper. Hope everyone enjoyed the Ai summer of 2023. This work is meant to increase the scope of the marketplace, not take away an avenue that can lead to one that is greater than the sums of its parts.

Be safe, responsible, and have fun!

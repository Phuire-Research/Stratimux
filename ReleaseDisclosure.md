# Release Disclosure
The internals of this application feature a design pattern released in 2018, ActionStrategy. This resulting framework and the creation of a Unified Turing Machine is the consequence of the complexity that this pattern imposes, despite its outward simplicity. Thus this framework simplifies the handling of its complex nature and solves the deficiencies of working with this pattern in preexisting frameworks capable of it. Noting that the Unified Turing Machine itself was an indirect discovery in order to handle such complexity.

If intelligence is defined by tool use. Then what you do with a tool is an action, therefore: Intelligence is just a graph of actions that perform some function.

Therefore a concept of a person can be defined by the actions they can utilize based on the concept of what tools are available. Same goes for Ai.

Therefore having a Graph Computation Framework oriented around Actions and Concepts in plain text. Is a hand written intelligence without the need for an Ai. Good think GPLv3 basically acts a definite shield towards a programming paradigm that out scales data entry of classic by default. As at the end of the day this is just a new turing machine and the goal is safety. It is counter intuitive restrict the release of safe provably terminating algorithms in a solved state.

Sure it taints the ability to ever truly patent something within this new Unified Turing Machine. The purpose of this work is to provide an additional avenue for entrepreneurship that isn't just algorithmic, but applied. Then it only behooves, especially if you find yourself in a difficult to defend position in the marketplace.

The nice thing about GPLv3 however it is also allows for a SaaS loophole. Where functionality can be utilized as a trade secret. Since my goal is a Scientific Platform organized around open testing and experimentation. Then it only benefits for the creation of Unified Conceptual Science via the open demonstration of logical programming as to relays to each field.

To some this might be the holy grail of training sound logic and reasoning into Neural Networks that is comparable to ourselves. For me, this is a framework that I have wanted to release as my self studied dissertation that has been on hold for 5 years. The Unified Turing Machine is my thesis, that it works the test, the documents shared alongside this repository the paper. Hope everyone enjoyed the Ai summer of 2023. This work is meant to enhance such, not take away in something that could be greater than the sums of its parts.

Be responsible, safe, and have fun!

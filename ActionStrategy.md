# Action Strategy
### Abstract
An alternative name for this pattern that would be more literal would be: Action Tree Strategy. The composition of this data structure includes the ability to trace back to previous nodes and likewise via an additional **decisionNode** parameter, the ability to further expand the data pattern to describe an N-Tree or graph that is finite in operation and concludes within the context of **Higher Order Conceptual Composition**.

The staked effect of this data structure is one that is capable of mapping the internal structure of some Neural Network. But the origination of this design was for the utilization of programmers to describe their own decision making process. As the scope of this pattern in combination with a stored ActionList is an Array that can be flattened into a sequential series of steps or a paragraph. This compositionality enables ActionStrategies to serve as both executable logic and human-readable documentation of complex transformations, especially when integrated with the **Stage Planner** and **StratiDECK** systems for enhanced muxified development.

As the original pursuit of this data structure was to utilize the data parameter to formalize a transformation of said data over a period of steps. To map the exact transformation of data through an application, versus a series of factories. This chain-like pattern of design is represented as a separate concept within this framework through **Deck typing** and **muxified concepts**. The framework is designed to be wholly responsible for itself through comprehensive spatial ownership design patterns. The main issue would be the change of data that the chained behavior may be dependent upon. To allow for that data to transformation across any number of nodes on a graph, we introduced the spatial ownership design pattern. Where the final destination for such could be the original muxium, the client's screen, or even the database of some server. This is a formalization of a greater than the sums approach to programming by way of composition, decomposition, and recomposition of sets of concepts, contained within some muxium that interacts with other muxiums through modern **ActionStrategyStitch** patterns.

### How Stratimux allows ActionStrategies to be a Data Oriented Format for Graph Computation.
Since Stratimux uses semaphores over strings types to formalize its own inner workings. The main functionality of strings throughout this system are for readability and being able to isolate some additional functionality at run time. Due to this approach, the net run time of a "Muxium" is just a series of entities(action/state/concept), arrays (staged plan), trees(action strategy), and graphs(staged plans + punted/sequence strategies). That can be made numerically pure with a compilation process to set the semaphores ahead of time. Therefore this system is functionally just a asynchronous graph programming framework that uses strings for user comprehension, and such can be stripped.

The only blocker in the scope of this current implementation, is that we find faulty actions, plans, and the concluding strategies via a type comparison. This can be further extrapolated away, but would save that work for a low level programming language. As the choice of Typescript in this project was due to familiarity and as the fastest path towards creating a MVP. This is mainly as a note for later as graph computation hits parity.

#### The Exponential/Higher Order Complexity of a Binary Tree
![The Exponential Higher Order Complexity of a Binary Tree](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/Stratimux/blob/main/TreeExponetial.png?raw=true)
The Reality of what the ActionStrategy Pattern represents despite deceiving simplicity, is the direct mapping of higher orders of logic. As if we examine the increasing levels of complexity of any given ActionStrategy. The complexity by default is squared or doubling. As each step in combination with its dynamic nature has the possibility of failure. If the muxium has the ownership concept loaded and a value of state has a lock, or via some other test that can be supplied within the governing method. It is interesting to Note how this relationship is obfuscated via mathematics, but plain in conceptual logic. That of a mechanical greater than the sums relationship. "As if you attempt to square one, you get one. And if you square the number of branches, you get four, but at the one that is the head of the tree. And represents a doubling, but likewise ignores the possibility of additional branches beyond the two."

This demonstrates the need for an additional level of control to handle this higher order/exponential quality. And the reason for the spatial ownership pattern to supply some baseline coherency for the possibility of failure of each action. This is due to how a strategy can run alongside in sequence with other actions/strategies that can transform values that the strategy is dependent upon. These other actions can be independently dispatched from some other subscription via an observation into the action stream. This is especially likely when performing transformations off premise in a network of muxiums.

"Would be the equivalent of attempting to build some car in a factory. But someone who was building another car, had taken the door you were intending on attaching to that car. Thus the failure mode of the strategy would be to find that next car door if not present, otherwise the car is left on the assembly line, or thankfully in the scope of programming. Just ceases to exist and all previously locked data or parts are freed to be used via other processes."

This represents the intelligence of doing directly. Versus the classical attempt at hand written intelligence of expert based systems as the closest analog, are flat by comparison. That perform knowledge retrieval in conjunction with some conditional logic to attempt to simulate human reasoning. In contrast this system of doing is composable and able to unify concepts via the ActionStrategy pattern. As these concepts can utilize some quality that may be of Artificial Intelligence, human interaction, function call of some API, or even another muxium. That represents the transparent how of that doing in order to transform data. Noting that explainability is a side effect of this verbose nature that is comparable to paragraphs.

Intelligence is a complex beast. And while there may be some additional helper functions or abstractions. This release represents a minimum viable product. As it is a genuine new form of programming and an entire field of study on its own. The ActionStrategy pattern merely relays to some pattern of dynamic decision making that a computer may perform without the probabilistic limitation of classical non-deterministic Turing Machines. And would be viewed as "Logically Deterministic" by categorization. And enable to creation of "Autonomous Baseline Intelligence," which would function like clockwork with a defined conclusion.

## The Anatomy of an ActionNode
ActionNode represents some node that is capable of being turned into some action when initialized by the ActionStrategy consumer functions. In v0.3.2, these functions work seamlessly with **Deck typing** and **muxified concepts** to enable off-premise interaction. As we could write such as a program by way of a series of functions to be called on some tree or graph, but these functions would have to be serialized. We take advantage of the semaphore pattern throughout to reduce the total size of each message and time till their discovery of functionality at runtime.

```typescript
export interface ActionNode {
  action?: Action;
  actionType: ActionType;
  payload?: Record<string, unknown>;
  conceptSemaphore?: number;
  priority?: number;
  keyedSelectors?: KeyedSelector[];
  semaphore?: [number, number, number, number];
  agreement?: number;
  decisionNodes?: Record<string, ActionNode>;
  decisionNotes?: ActionNotes;
  successNode: ActionNode | null;
  successNotes?: ActionNotes;
  failureNode: ActionNode | null;
  failureNotes?: ActionNotes;
  lastActionNode?: ActionNode;
}

// Enhanced v0.3.2 ActionNodeOptions with Deck typing support
export interface ActionNodeOptions {
  keyedSelectors?: KeyedSelector[];
  conceptSemaphore?: number;
  priority?: number;
  semaphore?: [number, number, number, number];
  agreement?: number;
  decisionNodes?: Record<string, ActionNode>;
  decisionNotes?: ActionNotes;
  successNode?: ActionNode | null;
  successNotes?: ActionNotes;
  failureNode?: ActionNode | null;
  failureNotes?: ActionNotes;
  lastActionNode?: ActionNode;
}

export interface ActionNotes {
  preposition?: string;
  denoter?: string;
}
```
* action - Is an union data pattern to bind the functionality of the ActionNode, ActionStrategy, and Action. This allows for each part to be responsible for itself and to allow for additional functionality at runtime.
* actionType - Is merely the type of action to be created at runtime, these should be verbose as to their intended effect as it informs the Stratimux sentence structure's body.
* payload - Is set to unknown to allow for the explicit typecasting during consumption, reducer, method, or principle. Be sure to import actions directly to ensure payload type safety in the reducer. This is a logical determination in line with Javascript core functionality.
* conceptSemaphore - Used when dispatching to a foreign Muxium. Where the effecting action will trigger on some muxified concept on such that the current muxium has observation of.
* priority - By default all action's dispatched via quality observations will be pushed to the end of the tail que on the Muxium. By setting this value, it will force the handlePriority internal function to trigger and assign the action to the determined slot on the body que instead.
* keyedSelectors - An Array of KeyedSelector that locks some property during the life time of the created action.
* semaphore - First is concept's index, second is the quality's index, and the final is the generation of the sets of concepts currently stored on the Muxium. *Explicitly setting this value, denotes a primed action without additional look up at runtime.*
* agreement - Is time in milliseconds of the lock's expiration time. Default is currently 5000, but such will be reduced upon testing and feedback.
* decisionNodes - Is a record of all possible decisions that the ActionNode may take depending upon some test. And should be seen as a replacement for SuccessNode if utilized. This is what makes the ActionStrategy capable of complexity beyond squared.
* successNode - Is the default chain of actions. Can be replaced by decisionNodes to enable additional behaviors.
* failureNode - Is the default failure mode of each action. And will be called if ownership is loaded in an muxium. If null the ActionStrategy will conclude which will free the current lock supplied. Otherwise it will be added to the pendingActions que. 

**ActionNotes**
* preposition - Coincides with the Stratimux sentence structure. And is the logical linking between the previous sentences and the current ActionType.
* denoter - Also enhances the Stratimux sentence as either a punctuation mark or additional description of the ActionType's intended effect.
*NOTE: Just like all optional fields, except action, these are designed to be set at runtime if dynamic or can be prefilled if the values are known prior.*
For Example if we are using the denoter to inform the Stratimux sentence of the explicit value an action has performed. Via the method or principle that can call the action's next ActionNode. Likewise is True for the preposition, that can source its selection Based on the strategy's LastActionNode Value as an Example.

## The Anatomy of a ActionStrategy
The strategy for short as the pattern that inspired this was the original strategy design pattern, noting the usage of methods over that of side effects in this system. The ActionStrategy is a union data type that stores the binary-N-graph/tree's ActionNodes representing any given ActionStrategy, enhanced with **Deck typing** for robust state management. We set ActionNode directly versus some helper function, due to the complex nature of creating these dynamic data structures in the sequential written format of modern programming. This is pending some user interface to allow for such to be compositional or even the creation of such strategies on the fly via some dynamic mechanism including **Stage Planner** integration or new emergent systems.

As this is an enhancement to the traditional understanding of higher order functions working within **Higher Order Conceptual Composition**. If such needs that specific flow, you may recall the LastActionNode or use such explicitly within a reducer, method, or principle. Noting that the method is already composed to transform the handling of the ActionStrategy itself. The difference here is the direct blunt nature. As even with higher order functions, the nesting is the same structure at run time, but likewise lacks the exponential quality of decision making of this pattern.

```typescript
// Enhanced v0.3.2 ActionStrategy with Deck integration
export interface ActionStrategyParameters {
  topic: string;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  initialNode: ActionNode;
  priority?: number;
}

export interface ActionStrategy {
  topic: string;
  data?: Record<string, unknown>;
  currentNode: ActionNode;
  actionList: Array<string>;
  puntedStrategy?: ActionStrategy[];
  stubs?: OwnershipTicketStub[];
  priority?: number;
  step?: number;
}
```
* topic - The topic string or the beginning sentence of a Stratimux dialog paragraph. Also stores itself temporarily upon strategy completion on the Muxium as **lastStrategy**. We suggest using this field to determine when your strategies of concluding during testing, or when to dispatch some other strategy.
* data - Is the data to be transform during the lifetime of a strategy when off premise. Otherwise the strategy solely transforms the state of each concept by way of the consuming reducer.
* currentNode - Is the current ActionNode of the given strategy.
* actionList - Is the store of all actions and their prepositions and denoters that formalizes a Stratimux sentence. This stores the topic as the first entry upon strategy creation.
* lastActionNode - Primarily functions to clear ownership upon each successive action from the strategy. Likewise can be used to determine the current decision, or preposition of the current ActionNode at runtime.
* puntedStrategy - This allows for strategies to be successively chained into one another by first in, first Out principle upon each strategy conclusion.
* initialNode via ActionStrategyParameters - The initial node that is the head that is ran by the strategyBegin consumer function.
* priority - This will assign a default priority to each action issued from a strategy, but allows for actions to have their own atomically.
* step - Mainly for trouble shooting purposes, but likewise may be used via some analytics for insight.

## Consumer Functions
The v0.3.2 consumer functions provide enhanced integration with **Deck typing**, **muxified concepts**, and **Stage Planner** systems:

```typescript
// Core strategy creation and management
function createStrategy(params: ActionStrategyParameters): ActionStrategy;
function createActionNode(action: Action, options?: ActionNodeOptions): ActionNode;
function createActionNodeFromStrategy(strategy: ActionStrategy): ActionNode; 

// Enhanced v0.3.2 strategy execution functions
function strategyBegin(strategy: ActionStrategy, data?: unknown): Action;
function strategySuccess(strategy: ActionStrategy, data?: unknown): Action;
function strategyFailed(strategy: ActionStrategy, data?: unknown): Action;
function strategyDecide(strategy: ActionStrategy, decideKey: string, data?: unknown): Action;

// Modern v0.3.2 strategy composition with Deck typing
function strategyDetermine<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(
  action: Action,
  options?: {
    topic?: string,
    priority?: number,
    data?: T
  }
): Action;

// Advanced strategy orchestration
function strategyPunt(puntedStrategy: ActionStrategy, newStrategy: ActionStrategy): ActionStrategy;
function strategySequence(strategies: ActionStrategy[]): ActionStrategy | undefined;
function strategyRecurse(
  strategy: ActionStrategy, 
  control: {payload?: unknown, data?: Record<string, unknown>}
): Action;
function strategyBackTrack(strategy: ActionStrategy): Action;

// v0.3.2 Stage Planner integration
function strategyStitch<T extends Deck>(
  deck: T,
  stitches: ActionStrategyStitch[]
): ActionStrategy;
```

### Enhanced Consumer Function Usage Examples

**Modern Strategy Creation with Deck Integration:**
```typescript
// v0.3.2 pattern with muxified concept integration within stage context
const createUserLoginStrategy = (deck: Deck<UserDeck>) => createStrategy({
  topic: 'Authenticate user with enhanced validation',
  initialNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userAuth.e.userLoginBeginAction(), {
    successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.serverAuth.e.validateCredentialsAction(), {
      successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.serverAuth.e.updateAuthStateAction()),
      failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userInterface.e.handleLoginFailureAction())
    }),
    failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.networkManager.e.handleNetworkErrorAction())
  })
});

// Integration with Stage Planner
const planStage = createStage<UserDeck>((concepts, dispatch, deck) => {
  const strategy = createUserLoginStrategy(deck);
  dispatch(strategyBegin(strategy), {
    iterateStage: true
  });
});
```
**Enhanced Consumer Function Descriptions:**

* **createStrategy** - Creates a new strategy with full v0.3.2 Deck typing support and returns such to be activated by the strategyBegin consumer function. Data of strategy may be set explicitly and will be type-checked against the provided Deck.
* **createActionNode** - Used in conjunction with createStrategy, leveraging enhanced v0.3.2 type safety. Keep in mind that ActionNodes must be defined in reversed order due to the dependency chain. Creates a new ActionNode that decomposes the supplied Action, ensuring payload type safety. ActionNodeOptions assigns which ActionNodes will be next within the final ActionStrategy.
* **createActionNodeFromStrategy** - Enables sophisticated composition of strategies beyond "strategySequence" and "strategyPunt" with full Deck typing preservation. Note that the returned ActionNode will be freshly recomposed based on the passed strategy's currentNode and will lose the current ActionList. ActionLists may be extracted manually for integration into your current strategy.
* **strategyBegin** - Returns the initial action of the strategy, updates the ActionList with enhanced v0.3.2 sentence structure, and creates a union binding between the ActionStrategy and newly created action. Integrates seamlessly with Stage Planner execution contexts.
* **strategySuccess** - Initializes the successNode action with enhanced type safety, otherwise if null will conclude the Strategy by returning the conclude action. If ActionNode or Strategy's currentNode does not set its preposition, will set such to "Success with".
* **strategyFailed** - Same as strategySuccess, but with failure semantics. If the preposition is not set, will set such to "Failed With". This is the default ActionNode called if a lock is detected while ownership is loaded, with enhanced v0.3.2 error reporting.
* **strategyDecide** - Decision key will override or be placed after the preposition if set, enabling sophisticated branching logic. Will be used to return the next ActionNode that the key corresponds to. If null, conclude action will be returned. Integrates with Stage Planner's decision-making capabilities.
* **strategyDetermine** - Enhanced v0.3.2 helper function that returns an action with a strategy attached, with full Deck typing support. This reduces boilerplate when handling actions in methods while ensuring type safety. Forces all actions returned by methods to have a strategy attached to ensure halting.
* **strategyPunt** - Returns a new strategy with the old strategy within the puntedStrategy field, enabling sophisticated strategy chaining. The punted strategy will execute once the new strategy concludes via the consuming functions, calling strategyBegin on first index of puntedStrategies if present.
* **strategySequence** - Takes a list of ActionStrategies and returns the first strategy with the rest placed in order in the puntedStrategy property. These will fire upon each possible conclusion of the included strategies, with enhanced v0.3.2 error handling.
* **strategyRecurse** - Used within specified qualities that have controlling mechanisms such as self-depleting lists to allow halting recursion. Enables asynchronous recursion with enhanced v0.3.2 ownership management. Maintains current action expiration upon each successive recursion and will fail the action if that expiration passes.
* **strategyBackTrack** - Designed for use within failure states of ActionStrategies and the functional part of the ownershipBackTrackQuality. Use with care as this functionality can create indefinite recursion if not handled properly. Returns the previous lastActionNode as a new Action with associated ActionStrategy and ActionNode without appending itself to the ActionList.
* **strategyStitch** - **New in v0.3.2** - Advanced composition function that enables weaving multiple ActionStrategyStitch patterns into complex execution graphs. Provides enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms while maintaining type safety through Deck integration.

*Note: The data field sets only the data of the strategy, if one wants to edit or set the payload. It should be done explicitly the createActionNode function and set by that specific action creator. Do note you may edit the payload once the new ActionNode is created.*
The same is true when accessing the payload from a reducer, method, or principle. As this system is purposefully designed to not function by way of nested types such as:
```
SomethingFactory<AnotherFactor<Factory>>
```
This was a purposeful design choice, if you find yourself doing such. Known this system is already complicated enough.

## Helper Functions for Standard Method Creators
You still need to create a function of type MethodCreator to use these Helpers. :MethodCreator = () =>  methodCreator
*Update Note 0.0.48 - Updated helpers methods to receive their governing concepts state, this is due to how the act of Unifying Concepts works within Stratimux. As without this approach we cannot Unify multiple "counters," to your loaded concepts. This allows for that muxified state to be made consistent via the "Universal Spacial Quality" of semaphores within this system.*
```typescript
export const createMethod =
  (method: (action: Action) => Action): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createMethodWithState =
  (method: (action: Action, concepts: Concepts) => Action, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethod =
  (asyncMethod: (controller: ActionController, action: Action) => void): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethodWithState =
  (asyncMethodWithState: (controller: ActionController, action: Action, concepts: Concepts) => void, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number)
    : [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createMethodDebounce =
  (method: (action: Action) => Action, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createMethodDebounceWithState =
  (methodWithState: (action: Action, concepts: Concepts) => Action, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number, duration: number)
    : [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethodDebounce =
  (asyncMethod: (controller: ActionController, action: Action) => void, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethodDebounceWithState =
  (asyncMethodWithState: (controller: ActionController, action: Action, concepts: Concepts) =>
    void, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createMethodThrottle =
  (method: (action: Action) => Action, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createMethodThrottleWithState =
  (methodWithState: (action: Action, concepts: Concepts) => Action, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number, duration: number)
    : [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethodThrottle =
  (asyncMethod: (controller: ActionController, action: Action) => void, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
export const createAsyncMethodThrottleWithState =
  (asyncMethodWithState: (controller: ActionController, action: Action, concepts: Concepts) =>
    void, concepts$: MuxifiedSubject, semaphore: number, duration: number): [Method, Subject<Action>] => {}
```
* createMethod - Your standard method, be sure to handle the action.strategy via one of the strategy decision functions, in addition to passing the action if there is no attached strategy.
* createMethodWithState - This will allow your method to have the most recent state to be accessed via the asyncMethod function.
* createAsyncMethod - Handled differently than the rest, you will have to use the passed controller to fire your actions back into the action stream.
* createAsyncMethodWithState - Will also have access to the most recent state of that action's governing concept.

*Note if you are implementing your own debounceAction, pay attention to how these method helpers work. They are handling a passed conclude from debounceAction within their map/switchMap. This allows for ownership tickets to be cleared if loaded.*
* createMethodDebounce - Will fire after the set duration with the most recent action, and filter previous actions within the duration to be set to the conclude action.
* createMethodDebounceWithState - Will filter actions within the duration while providing access to the most state of that action's concept. 
* createAsyncMethodDebounce - Will not disengage the initial ActionController, but will allow debounced actions to pass through when filtered as conclude actions. And will fire the most recent action upon its own conditions are met asynchronously after the set duration.
* createAsyncMethodDebounceWithState - Filters and then first the first action once conditions are met, and provides access to the most recent state of that action's governing concept.
* createMethodThrottle - Will fire the first action then filter the following actions as muxiumConclude
* createMethodThrottleWithState- Fires the first action, alongside the most recent state, then filters rest as conclude.
* createAsyncMethodThrottle - Asynchronously fires the first action, will filtering the rest for the set duration as conclude.
* createAsyncMethodThrottleWithState - Fires the first action asynchronously with the most recent state, and filters action during the duration as conclude to remove stale tickers from ownership if loaded.

## "Creator Functions"
Tje ActionStrategy creator functions integrate seamlessly with **Deck typing**, **Stage Planner**, and **Higher Order Conceptual Composition** patterns. This is a guideline to inform the creation of your strategies within the enhanced muxified environment.

```typescript
/**
 * Enhanced v0.3.2 standard creator function with Deck typing support
 * Use this as an argument, as we lose type checking of your functions arguments,
 * due to the current implementation of Typescript argument generics.
 */
export type ActionStrategyCreator<T extends Deck = Deck> = (...args: unknown[]) => ActionStrategy;

/**
 * Advanced v0.3.2 creator function with StratiDECK integration
 * Use this as an argument, this should be a "Curried Function" with your arguments carried over.
 * Enhanced to work with Stage Planner and muxified concepts.
 */
export type ActionStrategyStitch<T extends Deck = Deck> = () => [ActionNode, ActionStrategy];

/**
 * Modern v0.3.2 stage-aware strategy creator for enhanced composition
 */
export type StageAwareStrategyCreator<T extends Deck = Deck> = (
  stage: Stage<T>,
  context?: Record<string, unknown>
) => ActionStrategy;
```

### Enhanced v0.3.2 Creator Function Usage

**ActionStrategyCreator with Deck Integration:**
```typescript
// Modern user authentication strategy creator
export const createUserAuthStrategy: ActionStrategyCreator<UserDeck> = (
  deck: Deck<UserDeck>,
  credentials: UserCredentials,
  options?: AuthOptions
): ActionStrategy => {
  const validateStep = createActionNode(deck.d.userAuth.e.validateCredentialsAction(credentials), {
    successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userAuth.e.updateAuthStateAction(), {
      successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userSession.e.redirectToDashboardAction())
    }),
    failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userInterface.e.displayErrorAction(), {
      successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.userInterface.e.clearFormAction())
    })
  });

  return createStrategy({
    topic: `Authenticate user: ${credentials.username}`,
    initialNode: validateStep,
    priority: options?.priority || 0
  });
};
```

**ActionStrategyStitch with Enhanced Composition:**
```typescript
// Enhanced v0.3.2 ActionStrategy Stitch with Stage Planner integration
function muxium_createStitchNode(options?: ActionNodeOptions): ActionNode;

export const dataValidationStitch: ActionStrategyStitch<DataDeck> = (deck: Deck<DataDeck>) => {
  const validationEnd = muxium_createStitchNode();
  
  
  const validateInput = createActionNode(deck.d.dataValidation.e.validateInputAction(), {
    successNode: createActionNode(deck.d.dataValidation.e.sanitizeDataAction(), {
      successNode: validationEnd
    }),
    failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.dataValidation.e.logValidationErrorAction(), {
      successNode: validationEnd
    })
  });

  return [validationEnd, createStrategy({
    topic: 'Data validation and sanitization pipeline',
    initialNode: validateInput
  })];
};

// Stage-aware strategy composition
export const createDataProcessingStrategy: StageAwareStrategyCreator<DataDeck> = (
  deck: Deck<DataDeck>,
  stage: Stage<DataDeck>,
  context?: { batchSize?: number }
): ActionStrategy => {
  const processingComplete = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.markProcessingCompleteAction());
  
  const [validationEnd, validationStrategy] = dataValidationStitch(deck);
  validationEnd.successNode = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.processDataAction({
    batchSize: context?.batchSize || 100
  }), {
    successNode: processingComplete
  });

  const validationHead = createActionNodeFromStrategy(validationStrategy);
  
  const initializeStep = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.initializeProcessingAction(), {
    successNode: validationHead,
    failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.handleInitializationErrorAction())
  });

  return createStrategy({
    topic: 'Comprehensive data processing with validation',
    initialNode: initializeStep
  });
};
```

### Enhanced ActionStrategy Stitch Usage Patterns

**Independent Usage with Stage Integration:**
```typescript
// Enhanced composing strategy with muxified concepts
const executeComposedProcessing = createStage<DataDeck>((concepts, dispatch, deck) => {
  const dataState = selectState<DataDeck>(concepts, deck.d.dataProcessor.conceptName);
  
  const strategy = createDataProcessingStrategy(
    deck,
    processDataStage,
    { batchSize: dataState.preferredBatchSize }
  );
  
  dispatch(strategyBegin(strategy), {
    iterateStage: true
  });
});
```

**Advanced Composition with Error Handling:**
```typescript
// Enhanced v0.3.2 strategy composition with comprehensive error handling
export const createRobustDataPipeline: ActionStrategyCreator<DataDeck> = (
  deck: Deck<DataDeck>,
  inputData: unknown[],
  options: ProcessingOptions
): ActionStrategy => {
  const finalizeProcessing = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.finalizeDataProcessingAction());
  
  // Compose validation stitch
  const [validationEnd, validationStrategy] = dataValidationStitch(deck);  
  // Add error recovery chain
  const errorRecovery = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.attemptRecoveryAction(), {
    successNode: validationEnd,
    failureNode: createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.logCriticalErrorAction(), {
      successNode: finalizeProcessing
    })
  });
  
  validationEnd.successNode = createActionNode(deck.d.dataProcessor.e.processValidDataAction(inputData), {
    successNode: finalizeProcessing,
    failureNode: errorRecovery
  });

  const validationHead = createActionNodeFromStrategy(validationStrategy);
  
  return createStrategy({
    topic: `Robust data pipeline processing ${inputData.length} items`,
    initialNode: validationHead,
    priority: options.priority || 0
  });
};
```

### Real-World v0.3.2 ActionStrategy Examples

Drawing from actual implementation patterns in the Stratimux codebase, here are proven ActionStrategy patterns:

**Counting Strategy with Error Recovery:**
```typescript
// Real pattern from experimentCounting.strategy.ts
export function experimentCountingStrategy(deck: ExperimentCountingDeck): ActionStrategy {
  const { counterSubtract, counterAdd } = deck.counter.e;
  const backTrack = createActionNode(deck.ownership.e.ownershipBackTrack());
  
  const stepFive = createActionNode(counterSubtract(), {
    successNotes: {
      preposition: 'and finally',
      denoter: 'One.',
    },
    failureNode: backTrack,
    agreement: 1000,
    keyedSelectors: [counterSelectCount]
  });
  
  const stepFour = createActionNode(counterAdd(), {
    successNode: stepFive,

    },
    failureNode: backTrack,
    agreement: 1000,
    keyedSelectors: [counterSelectCount]
  });

  return createStrategy({
    topic: experimentCountingTopic,

// Pattern from debounceAddOne.strategy.ts
export function experimentDebounceAddOneStrategy(deck: ExperimentAsyncIterateIdThenAddToDataDeck): ActionStrategy {
  const stepTwo = createActionNode(deck.counter.e.counterAdd(), {
    successNotes: {
      preposition: '',
      denoter: 'One;',
    },
    agreement: 1000,

    successNode: stepTwo,
  });

  return createStrategy({
    topic: experimentTimedMockToTrueWithStateTopic,
    initialNode: stepOne,
  });

```typescript
// Real testing pattern from strategy.test.ts
const plan = muxium.plan<DECK>('Counting Strategy Plan', ({stage}) => [
  stage(({stagePlanner, dispatch, d}) => {
    const str = countingStrategy(d);
    if (str) {
      dispatch(strategyBegin(str), {
        iterateStage: true
      });
    } else {
      stagePlanner.conclude();
      expect(false).toBe(true);
    }
  }),
  
  stage(({concepts}) => {
    const muxiumState = getMuxiumState(concepts);
    if (muxiumState.lastStrategy === countingTopic) {
      const counter = selectState<CounterState>(concepts, counterName);
      expect(counter?.count).toBe(1);
      plan.conclude();
    }
  })
]);
```

**Strategy with Priority and Error Handling:**
```typescript
// Pattern from strategyPriority.test.ts
const [count1, strategy1] = generateRandomCountingStrategy(deck.d, 0);
strategy1.priority = 100; // High priority execution

const [count2, strategy2] = generateRandomCountingStrategy(deck.d, 0);
// Default priority

const [count3, strategy3] = generateRandomCountingStrategy(deck.d, 0);
strategy3.priority = 50; // Medium priority

// Dispatch with priority handling
handlePriority(getMuxiumState(concepts), strategyBegin(strategy1));
handlePriority(getMuxiumState(concepts), strategyBegin(strategy2));
handlePriority(getMuxiumState(concepts), strategyBegin(strategy3));
```

**Strategy Determination Pattern:**
```typescript
// Real pattern from strategyDetermine.test.ts
stage(({dispatch, d}) => {
  // strategyDetermine automatically wraps single actions in strategies
  dispatch(strategyDetermine(d.counter.e.counterAdd()), {
    iterateStage: true
  });
}),

stage(({dispatch, d}) => {
  // Works with payload actions too
  dispatch(strategyDetermine(d.counter.e.counterSetCount({
    newCount: FINAL_COUNT
  })), {
    iterateStage: true
  });
})
```

These examples demonstrate the mature v0.3.2 ActionStrategy patterns in production use, showcasing error handling, stage integration, priority management, and sophisticated state transformations within the enhanced Deck typing system.

## Conclusion: ActionStrategy in the v0.3.2 Ecosystem

If you are using this approach to compose strategies into greater graphs of functionality, each strategy should be composed with a final goal in mind that is returned as the tail. In v0.3.2, we compose strategies first with the sequence necessary to accomplish some objective, then provide different failureNodes and/or decisionNodes to afford for error correcting to obtain that final goal. Therefore each strategy when composed in this manner will still only return a head and tail, with enhanced **Deck typing** ensuring type safety throughout the composition.

### Integration with Modern Stratimux Patterns

**Higher Order Conceptual Composition Integration:**
ActionStrategies in v0.3.2 serve as the executable backbone of Higher Order Conceptual Composition, enabling the dynamic orchestration of muxified concepts within comprehensive business logic flows. The enhanced typing system ensures that complex strategy compositions maintain type safety while allowing for sophisticated decision trees.

**Stage Planner Synergy:**
The integration between ActionStrategies and the Stage Planner creates a powerful paradigm for managing complex application workflows. Strategies can be executed within stages, providing:
- **Controlled Execution Context**: Each stage provides a clean execution environment
- **State Isolation**: Muxified concepts maintain consistency across stage transitions  
- **Error Boundary Management**: Failed strategies can be contained within specific stages
- **Composable Workflow Design**: Stages can orchestrate multiple strategies in sequence or parallel

**StratiDECK Architecture Benefits:**
The v0.3.2 ActionStrategy pattern leverages StratiDECK's type-safe architecture to provide:
- **Compile-time Strategy Validation**: Deck typing catches strategy composition errors early
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Full IntelliSense support for strategy creation and consumption
- **Predictable State Transformations**: Type-safe payload handling throughout strategy execution
- **Scalable Architecture**: Strategies can be composed into arbitrarily complex graphs while maintaining clarity

### Best Practices for v0.3.2 ActionStrategy Development

1. **Embrace Deck Typing**: Always specify generic types for your strategies to leverage full type safety
2. **Leverage Stage Integration**: Use stages to provide clear boundaries and execution contexts for your strategies
3. **Design for Composition**: Create strategies with clear success/failure paths that can be easily composed
4. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Use decisionNodes and failureNodes to create self-healing strategy flows
5. **Utilize ActionStrategyStitch**: For complex workflows, leverage stitching patterns to create reusable strategy components

### The Future of ActionStrategy Patterns

The v0.3.2 ActionStrategy pattern represents a mature approach to describing complex, asynchronous decision-making processes in a type-safe, composable manner. As the framework continues to evolve, ActionStrategies will remain the fundamental building blocks for:

- **Autonomous System Behavior**: Enabling systems to make complex decisions without human intervention
- **Explainable AI Integration**: Providing clear audit trails for AI-driven decision processes  
- **Distributed System Coordination**: Orchestrating complex workflows across muxium networks
- **Real-time Adaptive Systems**: Creating systems that can modify their behavior based on changing conditions

The ActionStrategy pattern in Stratimux transforms the traditional imperative programming model into a declarative, composable, and highly maintainable approach to complex system orchestration. Through the integration of Higher Order Conceptual Composition, Stage Planner execution contexts, and StratiDECK's type-safe architecture, developers can create sophisticated, self-documenting systems that are both powerful and comprehensible.

This represents not just an evolution in programming patterns, but a fundamental shift toward creating systems that can explain their own behavior while maintaining the performance and reliability required for production environments. The ActionStrategy pattern serves as the bridge between human-designed logic and machine-executed behavior, creating a new paradigm for intelligent system development.

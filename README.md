#### *The Unified Turing Machine - aka Hand Written Intelligence of Doing*
*Note if you notice a strange set of capitalizations of concepts, this is a new format that is being formalized as conceptual logic. In addition, there was no generative intelligence used in the creation of this framework. This is 100% hand written.*
### Abstract
The inspiration for STRX was that of Redux or the FLUX design pattern. With several changes and for the sake of maintaining some similarities to that design for developers. While offering enough of a departure where the traditional store is now referred to as the **Axium**. Where an axium is a set of concepts that are unified to form a greater conceptualization. Namely that of your application, but in contrast to its inspiration and accomplished by the ActionStrategy design pattern and spatial ownership paradigm. Is actively encouraging to cross the streams of state, or to be specific that of the unifying concepts and their qualities. To create an application that is greater than the sum of its parts due to its composability.

### Concept Index
* [ActionStrategy](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/ActionStrategy.md) - Created in 2018, this is the governing concept that allows for the Unified Turing Machine to have a strong halting quality. Likewise the direct analog of higher order logic.
* [Axium](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/Axium.md) - Governing concept that contains the set of concepts that formalizes each axium.
* [Concept](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/Concept.md) - The programming abstraction of a concept that is decomposable to the sum of its parts via: state, qualities, principles, and mode.
* [Stage](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/Stage.md) - Introducing the stage design pattern. A specific helper function to prevent action overflow in action dispatches in subscriptions. 
* [Spatial Ownership](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/SpatialOwnership.md) - Streamlines the complex nature of the ActionStrategy as it relates to itself and other axiums. This is what allows STRX to be a graph computation paradigm.
* [Unified Turing Machine](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/The-Unified-Turing-Machine.md) - The governing concept for this entire framework.

### STRX - *ST*rategic *R*eactive(X) Framework
STRX is the graph computational framework release of a new Unified Turing Machine. The internal structure of this machine directly relays to a form of written intelligence of doing, over that of knowledge retrieval. But may be written to facilitate that same expert system paradigm of classic. The importance of this machine to the now of 2023, is the functionality of the ActionStrategy Pattern as it relays to human and machine intelligence. As the pattern itself is a Unified Set of logical explanations of doing as a series of functions. Unified to the mechanism of that doing via code implementations of that logical explanation. We organize using concepts as it relays to a historic pursuit of unifying all fields of science. And is the comparable comparison to a graph of machine learning universal functions, and the generated neural network of layers that aggregate to greater universal functions. The comparison to that of LLM, during runtime these actions are outputted to an ActionList that is later composed as a STRX sentence.

#### The Anatomy of a STRX Sentence
```
Preposition(/+)Decision + Body + Denoter
Example: Finally + Open Axium + to Notify Subscribers of State changes.
```
This allows for a STRX Dialog to be constructed in the same formalization of that of a paragraph. Where the strategy topic is the literal topic sentence of a paragraph. And is followed by all steps and possible decision that create a unified paragraph.
```
TOPIC + SENTENCE + SENTENCE + SENTENCE
Example: 
Axium Initialization Strategy. +
Begin with register Axium Action and Concept Streams. +
Then initialize Principles and set new Subscribers to General Subscribers list. +
Next set Axium to its current Default Mode Index. +
Finally Open Axium to Notify Subscribers of State changes.
```

Where the main difference between that of a traditional paragraph and the compositional structure of the STRX ActionStrategy. Is that these STRX paragraphs are capable of representing different decisions that inform the final output of that paragraph and its sentences. This can be likened to some high orders of logic via decisions made within the context of an ActionStrategy. Except in contrast to current understanding of higher order logic. It is a direct blunt mapping of these higher order conventions versus some nested obtuse nightmare. But likewise exponentially grows in complex the larger the ActionStrategy. This is the consequence and relationship of binary/N trees and the exponential quality of their branches quantified. The difference traditionally ignored here, is that we can logical trim branches. And majority of ActionStrategies will be of some sequential flow and short running in their life times.

#### STRX - Axium Flow Diagram 
```
Action -> Mode -> Method --> Action.Strategy ? Halt : -> Next Action --> Mode
               |                                                      |
               -> Reducer -> Concept[] -------------------------------|
                                       |                              |
                    Construct Emission -> Principle -> Action ------->|
                       *Mode Can Block |*> External -> Action ------->|
                                     Axium/Client/Server
```
To satisfy the requirements of a Unified Turing Machine, the axium is the entire recursive functionality that contains a set of concepts. That can transform its functionality via its mode, that actualizes the loaded concept qualities from the dispatched action. If the action has an ActionStrategy attached, then that the method emits the next action based on some decision. While the reducer informs of any new state changes to be supplied back into the concept stream and the subscribers of that change.

In addition, principles here act as a containing observer that allows for utilization of preexisting constructs. Which are applications/framework/libraries that cannot be decomposed to the sum of their parts and would have to indirectly interact with the action stream. To maintain some relevant functionality within the axium. The principles are subscribed to the inner concept[] stream. And can supply or emit values to and from that construct. Or even that of outside observations such as an API, or any external process.

## STRX was Designed Specifically to Mirror the Functionality of Neural Networks to Decompose their Black Box Universal Functions.

The above would be some neural network's universal function made to fit some unknown function via a fourier transform. If we know the function ahead of the time we may set the weights specifically to represent that function. The question that is obfuscated in current understanding is by what mechanism is this neural network choosing the next node on the graph to determine its output? As the decision is obfuscated by the weighted sum between each layer of the neural network.

![Neural Network Diagram](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/NeuralNetwork.png?raw=true)

This is the reason for STRX's recursive functionality. Is that the life time of an ActionStrategy is the exact point of comparison between that of a set of universal functions on a graph and the weighted sum between each layer in the graph above. But direct and without the need to calculate the others nodes in the network. As the method allows for the next node to be some logical deterministic instruction via its method. But the entire function is the net run time of that action through the axium's mode. As the mode is just a function that relays to composition of functions of a quality to it's reducer and method dictated by the ActionStrategy. Keep in mind a function is allowed to be composed of functions. Therefore what is obfuscated within networks, is not only the function themselves, but the decisions made between the neural networks layers that control the final output by weighted sum, based on some input. Except here the mode can be represented as a singular universal function or node, that does not have to rely on the sum of weights to divine a weighted sum to inform its output. And is instead direct.

This is what allows for STRX to act as a comparable mirror to that of a neural network, while succeeding it in a directed flow. Except that it is transparent and inherently more efficient via exact instructions. Versus the probabilistic derivative towards 100% accuracy the a universal function represents. For a neural network to be considered a comparably mirror to a Unified Turing Machine, would be to forgo the weighted averaging sum of layers. Would be the creation of some directed path that formalizes the output of the neural network based on the input. But that data does not exist and this framework, or rather Unified Turing Machines would be the path towards creating that data.

In addition if one accepts some logical determinism where we can disclude specific symbols that a classic turing machine would utilize. Noting that the quality selection uses semaphores versus type comparison of its inspiration. Then this system can be proven to halt via some specific configurations of concepts and their qualities. As the semaphore are the finite symbol reference table of a classical Turing Machine. Except here it is fully dynamic and may expand or reduce in its possible finite symbol selection at run time. And likewise represents the direct path through graph of potential possibilities in a blunt fashion.

We could limit use case like the its Inspiration as a State Machine to control form and functionality of some user interface, or client facing application. But in contrast, this system was designed with the whole computer system and internet in mind. And may be massively expanded and rewritten into other languages if they are able to Satisfy the same dynamic requirements of this system. Thus the graph computation model is purely agnostic to location and based upon the passing of ActionStrategies via messages. And is the spatial equivalent of a neural network, but without the need for the weight sum. But in contrast to its conception in 2018, it is now possible to use the same neural networks to decompose their functionality into a predictable safe compositions. That can further reinforce the same networks. As this is not to detract from that investment, but to provide a safe transparent mechanism of explainability.

This system may become more atomic over time to better represent the dynamics of our Sentences. But during specific stage, this is a fine starting point towards the decomposition of the complexities of intelligence. As the weighted Sum is still massively useful, when there is no direct obvious answer to find some solution to an input. But within this scope would be an entirely different type of neural network which does not currently exist. As that would be the generation of novelty over some averaged statistical gradient descent of known data. Is the same as attempting to find the next **Ah-Ha!**

## Release Disclosure
The internals of this application feature a design pattern released in 2018, ActionStrategy. This resulting framework and the creation of a Unified Turing Machine is the consequence of the complexity that this pattern imposes, despite its simplicity. Thus this framework simplifies the handling of its complex nature and solves the deficiencies of working with this pattern in preexisting frameworks capable of it. Noting that the Unified Turing Machine itself was an indirect discovery handles such complexity. 

This release has no license attached to provide a grace period to protect any potential patents that would result from the release of this repository. And should be considered to be a research release and work in progress. As it is the intention to fully open source this framework, host on npm, and translate into each programming language that might support it in the near future.

To some this might be the holy grail of training sound logic and reasoning into neural networks that is comparable to ourselves. For me, this is a framework that I have wanted to release as my self studied dissertation that has been on hold for 5 years. The Unified Turing Machine is my thesis, that it works the test, the documents shared alongside this repository the paper. Hope everyone enjoyed the Ai summer. This work is meant to enhance such, not take away in something that could be greater than the sums of its parts.

Be responsible, safe, and have fun!

# Safety Statement
Please note that while the ActionStrategy pattern is a fully dynamic method of programming. It runs into issues for the sake of its dynamics, as traditionally previous methods of programming are transaction in nature and built for data entry. This runs into issues within our good enough implementations of our computer systems. Via branch prediction. If not handled with halting in mind, which is why that is the hard focus of the Unified Turing Machine. The ActionStrategy pattern is fully capable of thrashing your applications memory via the creation of ghost actions, or duplicate actions that simply do not make sense.

This is a large reason why I have pulled the approach and proof of concept in the scope of the Unified Turing Machine at the beginning of 2023. But with the advent of the Stage Paradigm, such creates a correction to prevent the creation of ghost duplicate actions, as well as prevent action overflow. Thus if one is training a Neural Network on such an approach, be mindful that there is runaway potential if not handled with care. As the beginning of this year on my part was dedicated to solving the zero day of some party who was utilizing this approach as a trade secret. With this release, is the bundled experience of working with the ActionStrategy pattern over the last 5 years and attempting to find the safest implementation.

So while this approach can be considered as Holy Grail. Be mindful of India Jones and what cup the grail turned out to be.

# STRX
*The Unified Turing Machine - aka Hand Written Intelligence*

STRX is the Graph Computation Framework Release of a new Unified Turing Machine. The Internal Structure of this Machine directly relays to a form of Written Intelligence of Doing, over that of Information Retrieval. But may be Written to Facilitate that same Expert System Paradigms of Classic. The Important of this Machine to the Now of 2023, is the Functionality of the ActionStrategy Pattern as it Relays to Human and Machine Intelligence. As the Pattern itself is a Unified Set of Logical Explanation of Doing, Unified to the Mechanism of Doing that is the Code Implementation of that Logical Explanation. And when Composed represents a STRX Sentence.

### The Anatomy of a STRX Sentence
---
Preposition(/+)Decision + Body + Denoter

This allows for a STRX Dialog to be constructed in the same formalization of that of a paragraph. Where the Strategy Topic is the literal Topic Sentence of a Paragraph. And is followed by all steps and possible decision that create a Unified Paragraph.
```
TOPIC + SENTENCE + SENTENCE + SENTENCE
Example: Axium set Mode to Ownership, then Initialize Ownership Principle. Next set Axium Mode to Ownership. Set Ownership Initialize to True to enable Ownership Principle.
```

Where the Main Difference between that of a Traditional Paragraph and the compositional structure of the STRX ActionStrategy. These STRX Paragraphs are capable of representing different decisions that inform the final output of that Paragraph. This can be likened to some High Orders of Logic by Decisions made within the Context of the ActionStrategy.

### STRX - Axium Flow Diagram 
```
Action -> Mode -> Method --> Action + Strategy --------> Recurse
               |                                      |
               -> Reducer -> Concept[] ---------------|
                                       |              |
                             Construct -> Principle ->|
                       *Mode Can Block |*> External ->|
                                     Axium/Client/Server
```
Where the Axium is the Entire Recursive Functionality that contains a Set of Concepts. That can Transform its functionality via its Mode that actualizes the loaded Concept Qualities via the Supplied Action. That the Action may have an ActionStrategy that the Method Emits. While the Reducer informs any new State changes to be Supplied back into the Main Stream or Subscribers to that Change.

In addition the Principle is the Containing Observer that allows for Constructs, which are Applications that cannot be Decomposed to the Sum of their Parts. To Maintain some Functionality within the Axium. As the Principles are Subscribed to the Inner Concept[] Stream. And can supply or emit values to and from that Construct.

Finally the Axium also allows for the ability for External Processes to likewise Subscribe to and Dispatch Actions into the Axium. But this Subscription may be Blocked via a Specific Mode.


## STRX Quality contains all Functional Data that Pertain to an Action.

* ActionType - Is the Type of Action and Logical Explanation of Functionality
* Reducer - Alters the State of a Concept
* MethodCreator - Creates a Subject and Method that utilizes the Observer for Additional Control of Flow. Including that of Moving Actions off Premise, to be later remitted back into the Stream.
* KeyedSelector - Ops the Quality or Actions into the Ownership Paradigm and likewise can be used to Select some Aspect of State from the Set of Concepts.

The Ownership Concept must be explicitly loaded and introduces an Additional Mode that further Transform the functionality of the Axium. Which allows for the Locking of Values that Other Actions or Strategies may be Dependent Upon. And if that Strategy, or Action with a KeyedSelector has Taken a TicketStub of Ownership of that Value. Any Quality or Action that would Transform such are Added to a ActionQue until that Block is Cleared.

But if a Strategy is Dependent on that Value, that Strategy will Fail by Default. Thus a Specific Case must be attached to the ActionNode that Governs how to handle that Specific Case.

If an Action that has a Blocking Quality, but does not place a KeyedSelectors on its Actions. Only one Action of that Type may Exist at Once in the ActionQue.

Actions in this System are also allowed to Move off Premises and was the Inspiration for the Design of this System. That such can be a Server, Web Worker, Client, etc...

While these Actions are off Location. Their Tickets hold a Expiration time that would Invalidate said Action based upon an optionally set Agreement Value or Otherwise set to a Default Time. Freeing that Lock Automatically upon Expiration. But only if that System has Received an Additional Action. As the Gist of an Unified Turing Machine is that it only Runs as long as there are Actions in the Stream that facilitates the Mode. As it is a Recursive Function.

A Concept's Principle, Governs a Specific Set of Instructions that would allow for the Functionality of Other Libraries not Designed Specifically for this System. Otherwise these act as Action Emitters of some Value being Watched off Premise or Subscribed to within the Axium.

The Effect of this System is a Graph Programming Paradigm. That was Designed Specifically to Mirror the Functionality of Neural Networks to Decompose their Black Box Universal Functions. As the System is Recursive by way of Functionality, the Life Time of One Action within the Mode is the Exact point of Comparison between that of a Universal Function. As the Method allows for the Next Node to via some Logical Deterministic Instruction.

<Diagram of a Universal Function Next to Mode>

An Action in this System describes Functionality via a Quality that is initialized by the Axium's Mode and Semaphore that Corresponds. This is a Unified Format and Function. That is Further Enhanced via the Unified Logical Description of that Action and its Effect upon the System.

This is what Allows for STRX to act as a Comparable Mirror to that of a Neural Network. Except that it is Transparent. And if One Accepts some Logical Determinism where we can Disclude Specific Symbols. Noting that the Quality selection is by way of Semaphore versus Type Selection. Then this System can be Proven to Halt via some Specific Configurations of Concepts and their Qualities. As the Semaphore is the Finite Symbol Reference Table of a Classical Turing Machine. Except here it is Fully Dynamic and may Expand or Reduce in its the Possible Symbols at Run Time.

We may use this System in the Basis of its Inspiration as a State Machine to Control Form and Functionality of Some User Interface. But likewise this System was Designed with the Whole Computer System and Internet in Mind. And may be Massively Expanded and Rewritten into other Languages if they are able to Satisfy the Same Requirements of this System.

#### *The Unified Turing Machine - aka Hand Written Intelligence of Doing*
*Note:* These documents are written via a new Unified Logical Conceptual Format. Each unusual Capitalization within a Sentence represents a Concept, and in Sequence Represents a Set of Concepts. As this is the Formalization of a new Unified Conceptual Science via Programming with Conceptual Logic as its Explanation and Implementation through Code. See Footer Note for Additional Details.
### Abstract
The inspiration for STRX was that of Redux or the FLUX Pattern of Design. With several changes and for the sake of maintaining some Similarities to that Design for Developers. While offering enough of a Departure where Traditional Store is now referred to as the **Axium**. Where an Axium is a Set of Concepts that are Unified to form a Greater Conceptualization. Namely that of your Application, but in contrast to its Inspiration and accomplished by the ActionStrategy Design Pattern and Spatial Ownership Paradigm. Is actively encouraging the Crossing the Streams of State, or to be Specific that of the Unifying Concepts and their Qualities. To Create an Application that is Greater than the Sum of its Parts due to its Composability.

### STRX - **R*eactive(X) *ST**rategy Framework
STRX is the Graph Computational Framework Release of a new Unified Turing Machine. The Internal Structure of this Machine directly relays to a form of Written Intelligence of Doing, over that of Knowledge Retrieval. But may be Written to Facilitate that same Expert System Paradigms of Classic. The Importance of this Machine to the Now of 2023, is the Functionality of the ActionStrategy Pattern as it Relays to Human and Machine Intelligence. As the Pattern itself is a Unified Set of Logical Explanations of Doing as a series of Functions. Unified to the Mechanism of the Doing that is the Code Implementation of that Logical Explanation. And is the comparable comparison to a Graph of Machine Learning Universal Functions, and the Generated Neural Network of Layers of Universal Functions. The comparison to that of LLM, during runtime these actions are outputted to an ActionList that is later composed as a STRX Sentence.

#### The Anatomy of a STRX Sentence
```
Preposition(/+)Decision + Body + Denoter
Example: Finally + Open Axium + to Notify Subscribers of State changes.
```
This allows for a STRX Dialog to be constructed in the same formalization of that of a paragraph. Where the Strategy Topic is the literal Topic Sentence of a Paragraph. And is followed by all steps and possible decision that create a Unified Paragraph.
```
TOPIC + SENTENCE + SENTENCE + SENTENCE
Example: 
Axium Initialization Strategy. +
Begin with register Axium Action and Concept Streams. +
Then initialize Principles and set new Subscribers to General Subscribers list. +
Next set Axium to its current Default Mode Index. +
Finally Open Axium to Notify Subscribers of State changes.
```

Where the Main Difference between that of a Traditional Paragraph and the compositional structure of the STRX ActionStrategy. Is that these STRX Paragraphs are capable of representing different decisions that inform the final output of that Paragraph and its Sentences. This can be likened to some High Orders of Logic of Decisions made within the Context of an ActionStrategy. Except in Contrast to Current Understanding of such, is a Direct Mapping of these Higher Order Conventions versus some Nesting Obtuse Nightmare. But likewise Exponentially Grows more Complex the Longer the Strategy. This is the Consequence and Relationship of Binary/N Trees and the Exponential Quality of their Branches Quantified. The difference traditionally ignored here, is that we can Logical Trim Branches. And majority of Strategies will be of some Sequential Flow and short Running in their Life Times.

#### STRX - Axium Flow Diagram 
```
Action -> Mode -> Method --> Action.Strategy ? Halt : -> Next Action --> Mode
               |                                                      |
               -> Reducer -> Concept[] -------------------------------|
                                       |                              |
                    Construct Emission -> Principle -> Action ------->|
                       *Mode Can Block |*> External -> Action ------->|
                                     Axium/Client/Server
```
Where the Axium is the Entire Recursive Functionality that contains a Set of Concepts. That can Transform its functionality via its Mode that actualizes the loaded Concept Qualities from the dispatched Action. If the Action has an ActionStrategy attached, then that the Method Emits the next Action based on Some Decision. While the Reducer informs of any new State changes to be Supplied back into the Concept Stream and the Subscribers of that Change.

In addition, Principles here act as a Containing Observer that allows for utilization of preexisting Constructs. Which are Applications that cannot be Decomposed to the Sum of their Parts and would have to indirectly interact with the Action Stream. To Maintain some relevant Functionality within the Axium. The Principles are Subscribed to the Inner Concept[] Stream. And can supply or emit values to and from that Construct. Or even that of Outside Observations such as an API, or External Process.

## STRX was Designed Specifically to Mirror the Functionality of Neural Networks to Decompose their Black Box Universal Functions.

The above would be some Neural Network's Universal Function made to fit some Unknown Function via a Fourier Transform. If we know the Function ahead of the Time we may Set the Weights Specifically to Represent that Function. The Question that is Obfuscated in current understanding is by what mechanism is this Neural Network choosing the next Node on the Graph to Determine its Output? As the Decision is Obfuscated by the Weighted Sum between Each Layer of the Neural Network.

![Neural Network Diagram](https://github.com/Phuire-Research/STRX/blob/main/NeuralNetwork.png?raw=true)

The reason for STRX's Recursive Functionality, is that the Life Time of an ActionStrategy is the Exact point of Comparison between that of a set of Universal Functions on a Graph and the Weighted Sum between Each Layer in the Graph Above. But Direct and without the Need to Calculate the others Nodes in the Network. As the Method allows for the Next Node to via some Logical Deterministic Instruction via its Method. But the Entire Function is the Net Run Time of that Action through the Axium's Mode. As the Mode is just a Function that Relays to Composition of Functions of a Quality to it's Reducer and Method dictated by the ActionStrategy. That a Function is allowed to be Composed of Functions. Therefore what is Obfuscated within Networks, is not only the Function Themselves, but the Decisions made between the Neural Networks Layers that Control its Output would be a Weighted Decision, based on some Input. Except here the Mode can be Represented as a Singular Universal Function or Node, that does not have to rely on the Sum of Weights to Divine a Decision as to its Output.

This is what Allows for STRX to act as a Comparable Mirror to that of a Neural Network, while Succeeded it in Directed Flow. Except that it is Transparent and inherently more Efficient. For a Neural Network to be Considered a Comparably Mirror to a Unified Turing Machine, would be to forgo the Weighted Averaging Sum of Nodes. Would be the Creation of some Direct Path that Formalizes the Output of the Neural Network based on the Input. But that Data does not exist and this Framework, or rather Unified Turing Machines would be the path towards Creating that Data.

In addition if One Accepts some Logical Determinism where we can Disclude Specific Symbols. Noting that the Quality selection is by way of Semaphore versus Type Comparison of its Inspiration. Then this System can be Proven to Halt via some Specific Configurations of Concepts and their Qualities. As the Semaphore is the Finite Symbol Reference Table of a Classical Turing Machine. Except here it is Fully Dynamic and may Expand or Reduce in its Possible Finite Symbol Selection at Run Time. And likewise Represents the Direct Path through Graph of Potential Possibilities.

We could limit Use Case like the Basis of its Inspiration as a State Machine to Control Form and Functionality of Some User Interface or Client Application. But in contrast this System was Designed with the Whole Computer System and Internet in Mind. And may be Massively Expanded and Rewritten into other Languages if they are able to Satisfy the Same Dynamic Requirements of this System. Thus the Graph Computation Model is Purely Agnostic to location and based upon the Passing of ActionStrategies via Messages. And is the Spatial Equivalent of a Neural Network, but without the Need for the Weight Sum. And in contrast to its Conception in 2018, it is now possible to use the Same Neural Networks to Decompose their Functionality into a Predictable Safe Compositions.

This System may become more Atomic over Time and in Totality to better Represent the Creation of the Dynamics of our Sentences. But during specific Stage, this is a Fine Starting Point towards the Decomposition of the Complexities of Intelligence. As One can even argue the Need for the Weighted Sum, when there is no Direct Obvious Answer to find some Solution to an Input. But within this Scope would be an Entirely Different Type of Neural Network which does not Currently Exist. As that would be the Generation of Novelty over some Averaged Statistical Gradient Descent of Known Data. Is the same as attempting to find the Next Ah-Ha!

## Release Disclosure
The internals of this application feature a design pattern released in 2018, ActionStrategy. This resulting framework and the creation of a Unified Turing Machine is the consequence of the complexity that this pattern imposes, despite its simplicity. This release has no license attached to provide a grace period to protect any potential patents that would result from the release of this repository. As it is the intention to fully open source this framework, host on npm, and translate into each programming language that might support it.

To some this might be the holy grail of training artificial intelligence to have sound logic and reasoning that is comparable to ourselves. For me, this is a framework that I have wanted to release as my self studied dissertation that has been on hold for 5 years. The Unified Turing Machine is my thesis, that it works the test, the documents shared alongside this repository the paper. Hope everyone enjoyed the Ai summer. This work is meant to enhance such, not take away in something that could be greater than the sums of its parts.

Be responsible, safe, and have fun!

*Author Note* I would like to apologize to readers who find this format uncomfortable. And will Exist as a Separate Folder upon Release of those Curious about this Format. As this Mode of Writing is now Comfortable to myself. As the true motivation, is to likewise decompose the work of those that write in this format. Of their own internal Universal Functions. By way of Capitalization, is the easiest mechanism to highlight Concepts, their Aspects and Qualities. Allows Writer to be Verbose of their Selection of Concepts in the Formalization of their Sentences. As it just so happens Nouns and Names correspond to the Same Format. And themselves are merely Extensions of Concepts. 

The next Primary Difference. Is that this Format was Designed to Exist without the Need for Symbolism. As that is the Classical Understanding of Logic. But likewise Symbols, or that of Letters are Sounding Symbols. And merely Store the Qualities of that Sound. And Represents a Fundamental Example of Conceptual Sets of Information, without Identification in Classic. As Symbols too Refer to some Name, but is likewise just some Arbitrary Association and Memorized Short Cut of some Shared Reference Table of Information. The power of Letters, is their Combination Quality that is Composable. Symbols resist that Specific Decomposability and are Constructs. And summarily Resist the Next Letter Inference that this Author Uses similar to that of a Machine. Is Pattern Recognition and the Ability to Predict some Word or Concept's Existence.

Finally the Usage of Terms such as "That," "Such," and "Some." Are meant to Carry some Algebraic Quality of a Store of Information. That is is not Some Coincidence that Mathematics was Originally Written in Such a Logical Format. Thus what are the Mechanics that Underlay our Language? This is a Purposeful Pursuit of That Understanding.

# Concept
A Concept is the solution to a long standing frustration with the FLUX architecture. That effectively if one bought into that system. The system of design did not readily create a method of sharing your feature libraries. Likewise what are features and why are features not allowed to interact with one another? Therefore the solution is the simplification of generalized terms to that of its origin, a concept. And by way of utilization of conceptual logic, we allow for these concepts to exist as sets. Therefore creating a new concept, by way of unifying their qualities via the ActionStrategy pattern as emergent phenomena.

**The StratiDECK** completes this architectural vision through **Higher Order Conceptual Composition** - where concepts can be muxified while preserving their distinct identities and enabling **lossless data oriented composition** at any level of complexity.

This easiest example how One might utilize this unifying paradigm, is the interaction with the FileSystem. That one could be transforming some generated data as of 2025, to then be later saved to the FileSystem as part of that ActionStrategy. These concepts can now be composed with other concepts to create emergent systems where each level maintains complete type safety and navigational access.

## Why Concepts over Constructs?
A Concept represents a bundling of functionality within some graph relationship. This can be such as their literal associations, but likewise the functionality of their qualities to perform some task, or satisfy some state transformation.
```
Conceptual Symbolic Expression:
(Force + Flint + Stone) + Dry Brush + Air = Fire
Logic Conceptual Explanation:
Using Force with Flint and Stone. Creates Sparks towards Dry Brush and Air, ignites to create Fire.
```
The above demonstrates the inherit conceptual quality of human language and highlights those concepts that may cascade some state changes into a subject. Such as the concept of sparks created from flint, stone, and force. Is an act of unifying some concepts spatially to form that of sparks. Which carry some transformational quality that can be applied to dry brush and the friction from air to create ignition and thusly fire. If this seems simple, that is the point. As we are introducing this simplicity to afford for greater explainability of the world around us. This would be the advent of a Muxified Conceptual Formula.

With our technology we may visit the exact logic that allows for this abstraction to exist. But for the majority, all that would matter is access to a developed library of knowledge that would facilitate such conceptualizations into reality for us. The goal is a system that is capable of: Car + Plane = Flying Car. And not only have such be created via some process, but the exact blueprints and the instructions for the rapid assembly to bring such into reality. Even better if we may simulate such before its creation and test to see if it is worthy to brought into reality in the first place.

**Higher Order Conceptual Composition** achieves this through **muxification** - the lossless composition of concepts where Car maintains its identity, Plane maintains its identity, yet Flying Car emerges as a new concept with access to both original concepts' qualities while introducing its own emergent properties. This is **Muxified Logical Programming** - where complex systems provably emerge from simple, proven building blocks.

The difficulty of constructs. Is that you cannot readily decompose their qualities and how they interact with their parts to make that construct. That there is some information loss in the construction process. As constructs are just concepts, just like everything else. We are merely working with the most simplified terms possible, for the opportunity of greater arrangement of sets. That constructs themselves can have qualities, but likewise using such in this system of study we would determine their decomposed parts. This is the pursuit of the new Muxified Logical Conceptual Science that is being formalized.

As in the scope of some rapid rise of generative information. This simplicity of concepts is the most fundamental mechanism to explain new information and discovery in any age. Insisting upon constructs, obfuscates concepts, and summarily the total bounds of what can be created. Would be similar to striking entire sets of numbers from equations is the most blunted example to the difference in approach.

## Stratimux Quality contains all Functionality that Pertain to an Action
```typescript
// v0.3.2 Quality Type System - Explicit Type Definitions Required
export type CounterAdd = Quality<CounterState>;
export type CounterSetCount = Quality<CounterState, CounterSetCountPayload>;

// Quality Structure (Internal representation)
export type Quality<S = void, T = void> = {
  actionType: ActionType;
  reducer: Reducer<S, T>;
  toString: () => string;
  methodCreator?: MethodCreator<S, T>;
  method?: Method;
  subject?: Subject<Action>;
  keyedSelectors?: KeyedSelector[];
  meta?: Record<string,unknown>;
  analytics?: Record<string,unknown>;
};

// Modern Quality Creation Patterns
export const counterAdd = createQualityCard<CounterState>({
  type: 'Counter Add',
  reducer: (state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }),
  methodCreator: defaultMethodCreator,
  keyedSelectors: [counterSelectCount]
});

export const counterSetCount = createQualityCardWithPayload<CounterState, CounterSetCountPayload>({
  type: 'Counter set Count',
  reducer: (state, {payload}) => ({ count: payload.newCount }),
  methodCreator: defaultMethodCreator,
  keyedSelectors: [counterSelectCount]
});
```
* actionType - Is the type of action and logical explanation of functionality
* reducer - Alters the state of a concept
* toString - Qualities are each assigned their own toString method to enable advanced configurations.
* methodCreator - Creates a subject and method that utilizes the observer for additional control of flow. Including that of moving actions off premise, to be later remitted back into the action stream.
* method - Is the implementation of the strategy pattern via to facilitate higher order functionality to enable additional composability.
* subject - Used within the mode to inform the method of an action to be consumed.
* keyedSelector - Ops-in the quality or actions into the ownership paradigm and likewise can be used to select some aspect of state from the set of concepts.
* meta - Decorator property, this is for internal use.
* analytics - This field holds record entries such as time, cost, and success rate. This is for advanced systems that perform analytics to better describe ActionStrategies and their selection at run time.

## The Programmed Definition of a Concept
```typescript
// Modern Concept Structure with Higher Order Composition Support
export type Concept<S extends Record<string, unknown>, Q = void, MuX extends LoadConcepts = Record<string, never>> = {
  name: string;
  state: S;
  muxified: string[];
  qualities: Quality[];
  actions: Actions<Q>;
  comparators: Comparators<Q>;
  keyedSelectors: KeyedSelectors;
  selectors: Selectors<S>;
  deck: ConceptDECK<S, Q, MuX>;  // NEW: Higher order access system
  principles?: PrincipleFunction[];
  mode?: Mode[];
  semaphore?: number;
  meta?: Record<string,unknown>;
};

// Muxified Record for Decomposability
export type Muxified = {
  stateMap: string[];     // Which state properties came from this concept
  actionMap: string[];    // Which actions originated from this concept
};

// Example: Counter Concept (v0.3.2)
export type CounterState = { count: number };
export type CounterQualities = {
  counterAdd: CounterAdd,
  counterSubtract: CounterSubtract,
  counterSetCount: CounterSetCount,
  counterMultiply: CounterMultiply
};

export const createCounterConcept = () => {
  return createConcept<CounterState, CounterQualities>(
    counterName,
    initialCounterState,
    counterQualities
  );
};
```
* name - The identifier of the concept to be used in conjunction with selection.
* state - Is the state of the concept of properties identified by the programmer to achieve functionality.
* muxified - A simple list keeping track of what concepts have been muxified to formalize the concept. Assigned via the muxifyConcepts function.
* qualities - Is a list of qualities that relay to the actions that mechanize the concept throughout your applications.
* **deck** - The **Higher Order Conceptual Composition** access system enabling navigation through muxified concepts: `d.outerConcept.d.innerConcept.k.value.select()`.
* principles - Are observers of state of your application or that of external mechanisms. That emit some action into the muxium based upon that observation.
* mode - A mode is a function and point of recursion of the runtime that the concept may utilize to achieve a specific functionality necessary for that concept. This should rarely be expanded upon.
* meta - Decorator property, this is for internal use.

## Higher Order Conceptual Composition: Muxification in Practice (v0.3.2)

The **Stratideck** system enables **muxification** - the lossless composition of concepts while preserving their distinct identities:

```typescript
import { muxifyConcepts, createConcept, muxification } from 'stratimux';
import { createCounterConcept, CounterState, CounterQualities, CounterDeck } from './concepts/counter/counter.concept';

// Create isolated concept instances for different services
const userSessionCounter = muxifyConcepts([createCounterConcept()], createConcept('userSessionCounter', {}));
const apiCallCounter = muxifyConcepts([createCounterConcept()], createConcept('apiCallCounter', {}));
const databaseQueryCounter = muxifyConcepts([createCounterConcept()], createConcept('databaseQueryCounter', {}));

// Higher Order Composition: Compose service counters into monitoring system
const serviceMonitor = muxifyConcepts(
  [userSessionCounter, apiCallCounter, databaseQueryCounter], 
  createConcept('serviceMonitor', {})
);

// Type-safe DECK composition for higher order access
type ServiceDeck = {
  userSessionCounter: Concept<CounterState, CounterQualities, CounterDeck>;
  serviceMonitor: Concept<CounterState, CounterQualities, {
    userSessionCounter: Concept<CounterState, CounterQualities, CounterDeck>;
    databaseQueryCounter: Concept<CounterState, CounterQualities, CounterDeck>;
  }>;
};

const systemMuxium = muxification<ServiceDeck>('Distributed System Monitor', {
  userSessionCounter,
  serviceMonitor
});

// Higher order conceptual navigation through muxified concepts
systemMuxium.plan<ServiceDeck>('Service Monitoring Plan', ({stage}) => [
  stage(({dispatch, d}) => {
    // Access deeply nested concepts with full type safety
    dispatch(d.serviceMonitor.d.userSessionCounter.e.counterAdd());
    dispatch(d.serviceMonitor.d.databaseQueryCounter.e.counterAdd());
  }),
  stage(({d}) => {
    // Type-safe value access at any composition level
    const userSessions = d.serviceMonitor.d.userSessionCounter.k.count.select();
    const dbQueries = d.serviceMonitor.d.databaseQueryCounter.k.count.select();
    console.log(`User Sessions: ${userSessions}, DB Queries: ${dbQueries}`);
  })
]);
```

**What makes this Higher Order:**
- Each concept maintains its **distinct identity** within compositions
- **Lossless composition** - no functionality is lost during muxification  
- **Spatial navigation** - concepts can be accessed via their position in the compositional graph
- **Type safety** preserved at every level of composition
- **Muxified records** enable runtime introspection and agnostic quality selection
## Principle - Conceptual Initialization and Observation (v0.3.2)
``` typescript
export type PrincipleFunction = (
  observer: Subscriber<Action>,
  concepts: Concepts,
  concept$: MuxifiedSubject,
  conceptSemaphore: number
) => void;

export function createPrinciple$(
  principleFunc: PrincipleFunction,
  concepts: Concepts,
  concepts$: MuxifiedSubject,
  conceptSemaphore: number
): Observable<Action>;

// Modern Principle Example (Counter Async Iteration)
export const counterAsyncIteratePrinciple: CounterPrinciple = (
  observer, 
  concepts, 
  concept$, 
  semaphore
) => {
  const counterState = selectMuxifiedState<CounterState>(concepts, semaphore);
  if (counterState && counterState.asyncIterations > 0) {
    const plan = createAsyncIterationPlan();
    concept$.plan(plan.title, plan.planner);
  }
};
```
Concept's principle, governs a specific set of instructions that would allow for the functionality of other libraries not designed specifically for this system. Otherwise these act as action emitters of some value being watched off premise or subscribed to within the muxium.

Likewise this contrasts other forms of programming. As the principle allows for the entire scope of the muxium to be self sustaining without the interaction from external resources. As the muxification function in reality is the only necessary line that is required to enable this functionality.

Therefore when one is designing their own concepts. The principle should be treated in the same capacity as the initialization of other programming approaches. The main difference, is to dispatch actions from the principle either via the stage paradigm or the supplied observer. The use of observer.next() is to pass actions during initialization, but should instead stage when observing state to prevent action overflow.

**In Higher Order Conceptual Composition**, principles enable **automatic concept lifecycle management** within muxified hierarchies:

```typescript
// Principle with Muxified State Access
export const serviceMonitorPrinciple: ConceptPrinciple = (
  observer, 
  concepts, 
  concept$, 
  semaphore
) => {
  // Access any muxified concept state regardless of composition depth  
  const serviceState = selectMuxifiedState<ServiceMonitorState>(concepts, semaphore);
  const userSessionState = selectMuxifiedState<CounterState>(concepts, findConceptSemaphore(concepts, 'userSessionCounter'));
  
  if (serviceState?.alertThreshold && userSessionState?.count > serviceState.alertThreshold) {
    // Principle can dispatch actions to any concept in the muxified hierarchy
    observer.next(createAction('ALERT_HIGH_USER_SESSIONS', { 
      count: userSessionState.count,
      threshold: serviceState.alertThreshold 
    }));
  }
  
  // Principles maintain spatial awareness of their muxified position
  if (concept$.deck.d.userSessionCounter) {
    concept$.plan('Monitor User Sessions', ({stage}) => [
      stage(({dispatch, d}) => {
        // Higher order access within principles
        dispatch(d.userSessionCounter.e.counterAdd());
      })
    ]);
  }
};

An additional workflow to can be place to complete responsibility of the principle on its governing concepts. Is a simple enabled property that the principle may be subscribed to. This allows the principle to cancel any internal observations that would be left hot. During the closing functionality of the muxium, or the removal of that governing concept.

As this functionality lacks the addition of some abstraction to hand hold the user. The principle function must be well designed to honor its namesake. But comes with all batteries included to avoid dependency injection.

Later we may create specific types of principles to handle the nuances of repeating the same functionality over and over again. But likewise that is not the scope of this release.

*Note the concept semaphore is specifically in utilization with "selectMuxifiedState(concepts, semaphore)" to select your Concept's state regardless of its current state of muxification.*

### Principle Benefits in Higher Order Composition

**Spatial Awareness**: Principles can access their exact position within muxified hierarchies and navigate to related concepts through the DECK system.

**Lifecycle Management**: When concepts are removed from muxified compositions, their principles automatically detect the change and can gracefully disengage hot observables.

**Cross-Conceptual Communication**: Principles can emit actions targeting any concept within the muxified structure, enabling sophisticated inter-concept coordination.

**Load Balancing**: Individual concepts and their principles can be separated into different processes while maintaining their compositional relationships.

## Mode - The Point of Recursion and Action Flow Control (v0.3.2)
```typescript
export type Mode<Q = void, C extends LoadConcepts = LoadConcepts, S = void> = (
  [action, concepts, action$, concepts$]: [
    Action,
    Concepts,
    Subject<Action>,
    MuxifiedSubject<Q, C, S>,
  ]
) => void;

// Modern Mode Example: Enhanced Blocking Mode with Muxified Support
export const enhancedBlockingMode: Mode<MuxiumQualities, MuxiumDeck, MuxiumState> = (
  [action, concepts, action$, concepts$]
) => {
  const muxiumState = getMuxiumState(concepts);
  
  // Enhanced error handling for muxified concepts
  if (action.semaphore[0] !== -1 && concepts[action.semaphore[0]]) {
    const concept = concepts[action.semaphore[0]];
    const quality = concept.qualities[action.semaphore[1]];
    
    if (quality) {
      // Execute quality with full DECK support
      const newState = quality.reducer(concept.state, action, concepts$.deck);
      
      if (newState !== null) {
        // Update concepts with muxified record tracking
        updateMuxifiedConcepts(concepts, action.semaphore[0], newState);
        concepts$.nextBlocking(concepts, updatedSelectors);
      }
    }
  }
};
```
This is similar to the principle function that is lacking some hand holding capacity. And if one is creating new modes to govern the flow of actions within the muxium. One should be mindful of the implementation of permissiveMode, blockingMode, and ownershipMode. And should be avoided, for the sake of enhancement, is allowed for the one's own explorations with the concept.

Where ownershipMode implements the blockingMode and some defaultMode as its final mode call. But if one were to use some mode that would otherwise replace ownership, but require such. One only needs to set the muxium's defaultModeIndex to their newly added Mode. This can be accomplished via accessing muxium's mode and state property of modeNames. Where the index of your modeName corresponds to the index that should be set to defaultModeIndex.

Otherwise if you are modifying or extending ownership's functionality and be sure to inform it that no longer responsible for itself. Including setting your own mode that extends ownershipMode and include such as part of your own initialization strategy for your concept. As ownership acts as a guard function prior to running either permissiveMode, blockingMode, or your newly set "defaultMode," or new ownershipMode to be ran that reimplements those functions directly as its own version of finalMode.

This could be accomplished via some middleware approach within the actionStream. But the current mechanism that supplies type checking a series fo operators used via the pipe functionality of a stream. Loses type validation if attempting to set by way of some dynamically ordered array.

### Mode Enhancements in Higher Order Composition

**Muxified Concept Support**: Modes now understand the compositional structure of concepts and can route actions through multiple layers of muxified hierarchies.

**Enhanced Error Handling**: Failed actions in muxified concepts can be traced back to their source concept for better debugging and error correction.

**Performance Optimization**: Modes can skip unnecessary state updates when actions target isolated parts of muxified compositions.

**Spatial Action Routing**: Actions can be routed to specific concepts within a muxified hierarchy based on their spatial position rather than just semaphore indexing.

## Muxified Record System: Enabling Agnostic Quality Selection

The **StratiDECK's** deck system enables runtime discovery and agnostic interaction with muxified concepts:

**Decomposability**: Any muxified concept can be fully decomposed back to its constituent parts without information loss.

**Universal Libraries**: Libraries can interact with any concept that includes specific functionality, regardless of how it was composed.

**Runtime Introspection**: Systems can understand their own structure and make decisions based on available functionality.

**Agnostic Development**: Developers can write code that works with any concept containing required qualities.

## The Theoretical Foundation: Logical Programming Extended

The **StratiDECK** proves that **Higher Order Conceptual Composition** extends **Logical Programming** beyond traditional functional programming:

### 1. Conceptual Compositional Completeness
Every complex system can be decomposed into simpler, proven concepts that can be recomposed without loss of functionality or identity.

```typescript
// Mathematical proof: Any concept C can be expressed as muxification of simpler concepts
// C = muxify(C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ, E) where E is the emergent concept
// And C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ are provably simpler than C
const complexSystem = muxifyConcepts([userAuth, dataProcessor, networkManager], emergentBehavior);
```

### 2. Identity Preservation Under Composition
Unlike traditional inheritance, muxified concepts maintain their distinct identities while participating in larger compositions:

```typescript
// Both concepts maintain their identity and full functionality
const gameManager = muxifyConcepts([playerScoreCounter, gameSessionCounter], createConcept('gameManager', {}));

// playerScoreCounter remains fully functional and identifiable within gameManager
dispatch(gameManager.deck.d.playerScoreCounter.e.counterAdd()); // Only affects player score
dispatch(gameManager.deck.d.gameSessionCounter.e.counterAdd()); // Only affects game session
```

### 3. Halting Completeness (Provable Termination)
Action Strategies within muxified concepts enable provable termination:

```typescript
// Strategy execution is provably terminating because:
// 1. Strategy graphs are finite
// 2. Each action node has defined success/failure paths  
// 3. Conclude actions provide guaranteed termination points
export function provablyTerminatingStrategy<T extends Deck>(deck: T): ActionStrategy {
  return createStrategy({
    topic: 'Provably Terminating Operation',
    initialNode: createActionNode(deck.aConcept.e.someAction(), {
      successNode: createActionNode(deck.bConcept.e.conclude(), {
        successNode: null
      }), // Guaranteed termination
      failureNode: createActionNode(deck.aConcept.e.someActionFailed())  // Error Correcting Guaranteed termination
    })
  });
}
```

## Closing Thoughts on this Approach of Concepts
The design of this approach is to be open and transparent of its implementations to encourage some exploration by others. As the goal is decomposability as a method of discovery towards some universal concepts. Which would be signified via stable concepts and qualities that are repeatedly reused between unlike concepts. And constitutes a form of efficiency upon discovery. As the truth of intelligence, is that the goal of communication by way of simplicity. Complexity may need be required for some highly entropic organization, but simplicity is the goal by way of explainability.

As what point is some intelligent notion, without some shared reference? How can one know if what they hold is true and valid without testing. As a flawed individual, I would always choose chance of failure, over that of perfection for the sake of enhancing understanding. As intelligence is complex, but likewise within that complexity can one find themselves without that common point of reference. And this is my attempt to establish such. Noting that there are very few references throughout this work. And concepts and logical associations take the center stage.

Beyond the scope of this application. Would be a method of being able to translate these concepts into any other language as they come into being. The power of intelligence comes from seeing the world as mundane, but respecting the decisions made. As even in the scope of this work. I never planned on creating a framework, nor the logical system that it represents. I attempted to extend FLUX to serve my own purpose with that ActionStrategy pattern. But at every turn, someone else's naming decision reared its head that hampered my ability to articulate the Muxified Turing Machine.

**The StratiDECK** now proves that **Higher Order Conceptual Composition** enables true conceptual universality. Where concepts maintain their essential nature while participating in increasingly complex compositions. This represents not just a programming paradigm, but a logical system capable of describing and implementing any conceivable system through provably correct composition.

The achievement of **lossless functional composition** with **identity preservation** means that concepts can be shared, reused, and combined at any scale while maintaining their essential properties. This is the mathematical foundation for truly universal concept libraries.

If my Own Work of Concepts gets in your way. Have fun!

**Addendum (v0.3.2)**: The completion of Higher Order Conceptual Composition means that concepts are no longer bound by the limitations of traditional programming paradigms. They are universally composable building blocks that maintain their logical coherence at any level of complexity. This is the realization of true Logical Programming - where correctness emerges from composition rather than construction.

*It is interesting to note that there is no common symbol for concepts, but there is a concept for symbols. In Higher Order Conceptual Composition, symbols themselves become muxified concepts that can compose into new forms of meaning.*
